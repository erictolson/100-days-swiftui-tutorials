# 100-days-swiftui-tutorials
These projects are the result of following Paul Hudson's "100 Days of SwiftUI" tutorial. Please note, these projects are the result of 'follow-along' tutorials and are almost entirely the work of Paul Hudson, modestly customized by myself as part of the tutorial program. See Paul's project files <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI" target="_blank">here</a>. For 'original' work that resulted from this program, please see the individual 100 Days of Swift UI 'milestone' projects in my repository list. Please see the below project demos on an iPhone 14 Pro simulator.

<b>Project 1: WeSplit</b> - This check divider app takes user input for a dollar amount, number of people, and tip percentage, and displays the check total with tip and amount per person.

<b>Project 4: BetterRest</b> - This app leverages maching learning (CoreML) to automatically tell the user when to go to bed based on wake up time, desired sleep amount, and coffee intake. Please note these recommendations are arbitrarily determined and do not mean anything.
