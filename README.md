# 100-days-swiftui-tutorials
These projects are the result of following Paul Hudson's "100 Days of SwiftUI" tutorial. Please note, these projects were derived from 'follow-along' tutorials and are largely the work of Paul Hudson, customized by myself as part of the tutorial program. See Paul's project files <a href="https://github.com/twostraws/HackingWithSwift/tree/main/SwiftUI" target="_blank">here</a>. For original work that from this program, please see the individual 100 Days of Swift UI 'milestone' projects in my repository list. Below are the project demos on an iPhone 14 Pro simulator.
